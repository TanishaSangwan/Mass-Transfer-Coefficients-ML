We will document all our developments regarding the study of mass transfer coefficients and the creation of the ML model for improved predictions of these coefficients here. It will be a rough and unstructured repo initially; hopefully, we will be able to improve this in the future.

Initially, I wrote a basic ML code for predicting the mass transfer coefficient of water in the experiment of CO2 in water.
Now I will compare our answers from this model to some popular formulas used for finding mass transfer coefficients.

BOOKS

-Transport Phenomena: This will be our starting point for our theoretical research. we have aimed to study about the theory for a week (i think i am getting too hopefull :) ) from this book. After this, we might migrate to other works for more detailed research.
